#### New Features

- Fn layer now supports Macros
- You can now move any pre-programmed Fn key to any other key, for example:

Arrow keys are pre-programmed by default on WASD keys by pressing Fn + any of these keys.

You can now move the arrow keys on the Fn layer to any other key, example below:

<!-- more -->

- Select a layer (1,2,3) by pressing Fn + C,V or B
- Press Fn + right CTRL to enter the programming mode
- Press Fn + the key you want to move the arrow to, for example Fn + L
- Press Fn + W to move the Up arrow to the L key, or A for left arrow, or S or D
- Press Pn key to save your change
- Press Fn + right CTRL to exit the programming mode

Repeat this sequence to move any Fn layer key around (note that you don't have to exit the programming mode every time, you can simply keep on moving keys around after you have pressed the Pn key to save your modification).

- Fn + Shift + ESC now inputs ~
- Fn + ESC now inputs `
- Fn + Z switch automatically to Default layer.
- Fn + C/V/B allows you to access the layers 1/2/3
- Fn + Right Shift still allows you to switch between layers
